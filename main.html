      <p>Somehow or another, our beloved staff found a video where you can enjoy seeing your dessert being made,
        while also enjoying the sound that comes with it. That’s right, lovelies!
        This blueberry ice cream rolls making video comes with ASMR,
        and as if that doesn’t already sound extremely tempting to watch,
        the video itself is recorded in 4K quality so you can immerse yourself fully

        <p>
        Our long list of desserts would never be complete without this one :
        the staple one-must-try dessert called the cheesecake! If you’re a fan of cheese and
        everything that’s made from it, this video is definitely for you. Made from a mixture
        of milk, cheese, cornstarch and cream, this shiny-looking soft and jiggly cheesecake
        made our mouths water just by looking at it. Made us wonder if we could just get
        them to deliver the cake directly to our office..!

          Not too much on the sweet stuff? Stay tuned, because desserts aren’t all about the sweet stuff.
          Just like life, sometimes you need some bitterness too - so that the sweeter times feels even better.
          For those of you who crave for the more mature side of the dessert collection, we suggest this video
          of an Oreo Tiramisu Cake made by the one-and-only HANSE. With a black and white finish to it’s look,
          this seems to be the perfect cake to enjoy while having an elegant evening tea.

        <h3>Rising to the Spotlight </h3>
        <p>
        With all the craze for bubble tea among youngsters lately, it’s almost amazing that we have never heard of this one.
        Apparently, there is a dessert called Black Sugar Bubble Pavlova, which is literally a
        combination of bubble tea and pavlova. With the ingredients that they are using to make it,
        we’re pretty sure that the results are going to be both absolutely sweet and bubbly, a weird combination,
        but that’s definitely not going to stop us from trying it one day!

          The first thing that came to my mind when I heard of this one was my mother. Souffle Pancakes,
          with it’s soft and fluffy finish literally reminds  you of a sunny and warm morning having
          breakfast among the people you love. With a small number of ingredients simply mixed together
          and fried under low heat, maybe you too can try making some of these for the people you love!
